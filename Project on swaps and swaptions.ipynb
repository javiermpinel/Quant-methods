    "## Modelling the evolution of the floating rate\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we implement a binomial tree model to simulate the evolution of the floating interest rate over time. A binomial tree is a simple tool for modeling stochastic processes, where the rate can move up or down at each step. In our model, the rate moves by a constant factor up, $u$, and a constant factor down, $d = \\frac{1}{u}$. However, one of the most important characteristics of interest rates in reality is mean reversionâ€”the tendency for rates to move toward a long-term average rather than drift indefinitely in one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate mean reversion into our model, we keep the traditional binomial tree structure but modify the way we calculate the probability of an upward move. We developed a way to introduce it based on the normal discribution function, instead of using a fixed risk-neutral probability formula. This is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we find ourselves at the $i^{th}$ node of time step $t$. Here, the floating rate $r(t)$ is $r_i(t)$. Then, as we move one time step forward, we say that the rate in the next time step, $r(t + 1)$ follows a normal distribution where the average is a weighted mean of $r(t)$ and $r_{mean}$, and the standard deviation is $\\sigma$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r(t + 1) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma), \\\\\n",
    "\\text{where } \\mu = (1 - \\alpha)\\cdot r(t) + \\alpha\\cdot r_{mean}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The following plot shows the probability distribution of $r(t + 1)$ when $r(t) > r_{mean}$.\n",

    "$r_{mean}$, $\\alpha$ and $\\sigma$ are provided as parameters to the model. We call $\\alpha$ the mean reversion speed. This way, the rate reverts to the mean rate at each time step, with a bigger effect the further away it is from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must combine this model with the tree model, in which an upward movement with probability $p$ takes us to $r_i(t + 1) = u \\cdot r_i(t)$, and a downward movement with probability $1 - p$ takes us to $r_{i + 1}(t + 1) = \\frac{1}{u} \\cdot r_i(t)$. In order to do that, we will define a rate threashold in the normal distribution such that the probability of an upward movement, $p$, is the probability of the rate being above that threashold. We take as a threashold the geometric mean between $r_i(t + 1)$ and $r_{i + 1}(t + 1)$:\n",
